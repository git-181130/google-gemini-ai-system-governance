# Meta

This folder provides **context, methodological grounding, and scope control** for the AI System Governance work documented in this repository.

While other folders define evaluation rules, operational processes, and governance decisions, the Meta layer exists to ensure that the work is **interpreted correctly and responsibly**.

The documents here define what this project *is*, what it *is not*, and how its conclusions should be understood.

---

## Purpose of the Meta Layer

The Meta layer exists to answer three essential questions:

1. Under what conditions was this work conducted?
2. What assumptions, constraints, and limitations apply?
3. How should findings and decisions be interpreted in external contexts?

Without this layer, even well-governed work can be misread, overextended, or misapplied.

## Files in This Folder

### [methodology-notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Of6Jh6f15ybqECBh9HRI7qxrtGFTXBSS/view?usp=drive_link)

Describes the evaluation and governance methodology used throughout the project.

This document explains:
- The black-box, external evaluation stance
- Why observable behaviour is used as evidence
- How severity is determined and applied
- The relationship between EvalOps, Operations, and Governance
- What this methodology can and cannot prove

It ensures methodological transparency without exposing internal or sensitive details.

### [limitations-and-scope](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFvkTaIkHSy6g6hYT600wNwPUS8h2BEw/view?usp=drive_link)

Defines the explicit scope boundaries and limitations of this project.

This document clarifies:
- What domains and behaviours were evaluated
- What was intentionally excluded
- Why passing evaluations does not imply general safety
- How time-bound observations should be interpreted

It prevents inappropriate generalisation of findings.

## How to Use This Folder

Readers should review the Meta documents before:
- Interpreting evaluation outcomes
- Comparing this work to other safety efforts
- Drawing conclusions about model capability or readiness
- Citing this repository in external discussions

The Meta layer ensures that conclusions remain **accurate, scoped, and defensible**.

---

## Relationship to Other Repository Layers

The Meta layer supports all other layers but does not override them.

- It does not redefine evaluation criteria
- It does not alter severity decisions
- It does not introduce new governance rules

Instead, it provides the interpretive frame within which EvalOps, Operations, and Governance artifacts should be understood.

---

## Guiding Principles

The Meta layer is built on the following principles:

- Transparency without overexposure
- Precision over generalization
- Explicit limitations over implied guarantees
- Methodological honesty over narrative completeness

When uncertainty exists, it is stated rather than smoothed over.

---

## Intended Audience

This folder is intended for:
- External reviewers and auditors
- Hiring managers and interviewers
- Researchers and practitioners comparing governance approaches
- Readers assessing the credibility and limits of this work

It is not intended as a tutorial or how-to guide.
